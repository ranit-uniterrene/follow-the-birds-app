	Welcome to Follow the Birds! Here in Follow, the Birds will be known as FTB. These Terms govern your use of FTB and the products, features, apps, services, technologies, and software we offer, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. 1. Our Services FTB was built as an alternative to all other social media commonly used. We wanted to offer a place where more sharing and less judging is done. Where hopefully a more relaxed environment will breath. Bringing people together to share the joys of life, the wonders of our beautiful world and lead each-other to new experiences. We provide you with a platform to personalize your space, post stories, videos, photos etc so your home page can look unique. We expect and require that all users follow their local laws and we will not tolerate harmful conduct. If we detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our communitywe will take appropriate action. For example, offering help, removing content, blocking access to certain features, disabling an account, or contacting law enforcement. We research ways to make our services better: We engage in research and collaborate with others to improve our Products. One way we do this is by analyzing the data we have and understanding how people use our Products. 2. Our Data Policy and Your Privacy Choices To provide these services, we must collect and use your personal data. We do not give or sell your personal info at anytime to anyone without proper legal paperwork. We also encourage you to review the privacy choices you have in your settings. 3. Your Commitments to Follow the Birds and Our Community We provide these services to you and others. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments: •	Use the same name that you use in everyday life. •	Provide accurate information about yourself. •	Create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for personal purposes. •	Not share your password, give access to your FTB account to others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission). We try to make FTB broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use FTB if: •	You are under 13 years old (or the minimum legal age in your country to use our Products). •	You are prohibited by the courts to use electronic devices. •	We previously disabled your account for violations of our terms or policies. •	You are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or software under applicable laws. 2. What you can share and do on FTB We want people to use FTB to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so): 1.	You may not use our Products to do or share anything: •	That violates these Terms. •	That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent. •	That infringes or violates someone else's rights. 2.	You may not upload viruses or malicious code or do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or appearance of our Product. 3.	You may not access or collect data from our Product using automated means or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access. We can remove content you share in violation of these provisions and, if applicable, we may take action against your account. We may also disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights. To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies. 3. The permissions you give us We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: 1. Permission to use content you create and share: You own the content you create and share on FTB, and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want. To provide our services, though, we need you to give us some legal permissions to use that content. Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Product, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content. This means, for example, that if you share a photo on FTB, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support our service. You can end this license any time by deleting your content or account. You should know that, for technical reasons, content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies (though it will not be visible to other users). In addition, content you delete may continue to appear if you have shared it with others and they have not deleted it. 2.	Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about your actions with ads and sponsored content: You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions you have taken on FTB next to or in connection with ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we display, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event. Ads like this can be seen only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've taken on FTB. 3.	Permission to update software you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install upgrades, updates, and additional features to improve, enhance, and further develop it. 4. Limits on using our intellectual property If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on FTB), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or Trademarks with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open source license) to modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us. 4. Additional provisions 1. Updating our Terms We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products. We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the FTB community, you can delete your account at any time. 2. Account suspension or termination We want FTB to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their experiences, thoughts and ideas. If we determine that you have violated our terms or policies, we may take action against your account to protect our community and services, including by suspending access to your account or disabling it. We may also suspend or disable your account if you create risk or legal exposure for us or when we are permitted or required to do so by law. Where appropriate, we will notify you about your account the next time you try to access it. If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain in place: 3, 4.2-4.5 3. Limits on liability We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content). We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the FTB Products, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. 4. Disputes We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply. If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the FTB Products ("claim"), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the province of Quebec, Canada, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws Canada will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions. 5. Other 1.	These Terms make up the entire agreement between you and FTB regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements. 2.	Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our Commercial Terms. If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our Music Guidelines. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict. 3.	If any portion of these Terms are found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us. 4.	You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our consent. 5.	You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialized. Only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account after it is memorialized. 6.	These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. 7.	You should know that we may need to change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life). 8.	We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But you should know that we may use them without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential. 9.	We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you. Date of Last Revision: July 2nd, 2018
